#' ## Results 
#' Due to the length of time it takes to compile the results, figures and tables 
#' were exported along with the Markdown folder instead of being directly 
#' embedded into the report. 
#' 
#' 
#' 1. Refer to **01_storm_events.csv** for details about the storm events during the project period
#' and **02_storm_discharges.png** for the discharges during the storm events. 
#' ![ ](02_storm_discharges.png)
#' 
#' 
#' 2. Refer to **03_rain_discharge_sampling.png** for a visual of precipitation, roof discharges,
#' and runoff sample collection times for the sample period for the project. 
#' 
#' ![ ](03_rain_discharge_sampling.png)
#' 
#' 
#' 3. Refer to **04_runoffsample_boxplot.png** for the distributions of log transformed 
#' runoff pollutant chemistry of samples collected and **05_emc.png** for the event mean 
#' concentrations for each storm event. 
#' ![ ](04_runoffsample_boxplot.png)
#' 
#' ![ ](05_emc.png)
#' 
#' 4. Refer to **06_cum_unit_area_load.png** for the cumulative unit area loading of 
#' each pollutant over the storm events sampled. 
#' 
#' ![ ](06_cum_unit_area_load.png)
#' 
#' 
#' 5. Refer to **07_summary_statistics.csv** for the distribution of unit area loads for the project. 
#' 
#' 
#' 6. Refer to **08_log_normality_testing.csv** for the results of performing Shapiro-Wilks testing 
#' for each pollutant. 
#' 
#' 
#' 7. Refer to **09_loading_statistics.csv** for the results of the Friedman Tests. 
#' 
#' 
#' 8. Refer to **10_retention.csv** for discharge retention rates for both roofs. 
#' 
#' 
#' ## Going Forward 
#' 
#' The next goal of this project is to export the data to create interactive dashboards using PowerBI.
